     - *Enemies*: Various creatures and Gruntilda the witch, who serve as antagonists.

     - *Collectible Requirements*: Certain numbers of Jiggies and notes are required to unlock new levels and progress through the game.
     - *Ability Unlocking*: New moves and abilities are taught by Bottles and are often required to progress or solve puzzles in the game.
     - *World Access*: Each world is accessed by completing puzzles in Gruntilda’s Lair, requiring the correct number of Jiggies.
     - *Transformation Limitations*: Transformations are specific to certain levels and allow access to otherwise unreachable areas but come with limitations on abilities.



**Analysis**
===============================================================================
     *Easy to Identify*
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     - *Objects* and *Actions* were straightforward to identify because of the type of gameplay, with collectibles, abilities, and exploration being central to how you interact with the game.
     - *Play Space* was also easy to define, given that Gruntilda's Lair serves as a hub world, and each level has its own distinct environment.
     
     *Hard to Identify*
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     - *Goals* can also be challenging to distinguish, especially the optional ones. The game is open-ended in some ways, allowing players to decide how thoroughly they want to explore and what side objectives they wish to complete, making the line between primary and secondary goals a bit blurred.
